## Description

Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is a strategic twist on the classic game. Instead of one 3x3 board, it features a 3x3 grid of smaller Tic Tac Toe boards. This increases complexity and demands foresight.  
The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** enhanced with **alpha-beta pruning** for intelligent decision-making.

## Game Rules

1. The game consists of nine 3x3 boards arranged to form a larger 3x3 grid.
2. Each cell of the main board contains a small 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board.
3. A player must win three small boards in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win the game.
4. When a player wins in any 3x3 board, they get to play the next turn as well.
